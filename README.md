Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Gustavo Schwarz**, a computer science enthusiast, currently wrapping up my degree at _Mackenzie University_. I have a passion for tackling challenging problems, using any programming language at hand.

I've been involved in various projects ranging from development planning, databases, artificial intelligence, servers, frontend development, data pipeline integration across networks, to server and supercomputer configuration. I take pride in solving problems my own way.

I'm the developer behind [**splus.cloud**](https://splus.cloud) and responsible for the entire data distribution process within the project, from database insertion and virtual machine organization to data presentation on the frontend. Excited to see where this path takes me!

I publish by the name of G.B. Oliveira Schwarz, check out some articles [**Articles Page**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vNFxZG8AAAAJ&hl=pt-BR) ! It's not complete, but most of them are there. 

Please note that most of my GitHub repositories are private due to security reasons, but I'm a big fan of open source and enjoy sharing my code as much as possible.
