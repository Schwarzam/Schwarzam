Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Gustavo Schwarz**, a 23-year-old computer science enthusiast, currently wrapping up my degree at _Mackenzie University_. I have a passion for tackling challenging problems in the name of science, using any programming language at hand, and I'm always eager to learn new technologies.

Throughout my journey, I've been involved in various projects ranging from development planning, databases, artificial intelligence, servers, frontend development, data pipeline integration across networks, to server and supercomputer configuration. I take pride in solving problems my own way.

I'm the developer behind [**splus.cloud**](https://splus.cloud) and responsible for the entire data delivery process within the project, from database insertion and virtual machine organization to data presentation on the frontend. Excited to see where this path takes me!

I publish by the name of G.B.O Schwarz, check out some articles [**Articles Page**](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/G-B-Oliveira-Schwarz-2192491656) ! It's not complete, but most of them are there.
